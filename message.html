        Happy monthsary to us baby! First of all gusto kong sabihin na hindi lahat to code ko HAHAHAAA, you know what I meant by that syempre.
        I just want you to know that Im thankful that I met you (ikaw nag chat HAHAHAHAHA) I love you so much and thank you for being there for me always,
        hope you like what I made kahit parang broken and kulang kulang pagkagawa ko HAHAAHHAHA, nagsisisi me now di ako nakinig kay sir super noon edi sana mas maganda to HAHAHAHAAHAH.
        Im sorry kung di siya written because I wanted it to be maganda naman kasi Im really not good in creating mga stuff tulad nung letter mo sakin huhuhuhu, I'll bawi to you sunod
        bilihan sana kita kb kaso sabi mo RK gusto mo kaya next time nalang HAHAHAHAHA, I'LL BAWI SAYO LIBRE NALANG MUNA KITA PROBEN HEHEHEHE. In this past 3 months na naging tayo you
        made me realize a lot of things whenever we fight, you also helped me understand you better and I'm thankful that you have the patience to teach or tell me about your mental health,
        as I was always saying, I want you to tell me every time you have a problem, I'll always be right by your side whatever happen, I love love love you so much baby!! I wanted to say
        a lot to you kaso di ko alam pano ko siya sasabihin HAHAAHAHAHAHA, I may not be a perfect boyfriend but I'll do my best to be the perfect that you deserve. Sorry for the mistakes
        I've done and for having so much pride (SOMETIMES LANG) whenever we fight, but I assure you that I wont do it again and be more careful to the things that I do. I do not want to see
        you crying and thinking that you (or your BPD) are the reason whenever we fight, you won't be acting like that if I did not do something wrong dibaaa?? I want to show you how much
        I love you in a lot of ways but I do not know how to do it HAHAHAAHAH, I hope you know how much I really love you. Just like the song says "You hold me like I'm the one who's precious I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around.",
        I love you yve!! I'm so lucky na nagchat ka sakin hehehehehe. ILOVEYOU SO MUCH!!!!!!
